            <p class="lead">Workshops</p>
            <p>For the past 20 years, John Free has been conducting workshops teaching street photography in various locations around the world, including New York, Los Angeles, and London. He believes that learning street photography can help people improve themselves in the other photographic disciplines: portraiture, wedding, and photojournalism to name a few.</p>
            <p class="lead">How John Free has influenced me</p>
            <p>I have been a photographer for several years now. John Free was one fo the first photographers that I followed early on in my journey.
            </p>
            <p>I beleive that street photography is one of the best ways to document life as it happens in the moment. It's also the best way to document history in the making. I try to catch people in all of their candid moments, and I hope to convey some kind of emotion out of people who view my photographic works.</p>
